They aim to build the operating system for commerce, through a combination of world-class infrastructure, logistics operations of the highest quality, and cutting-edge engineering and technology capabilities. 

The Data team builds intelligence and capabilities using this data that helps them to widen the gap between the quality, efficiency, and profitability of their business versus their competitors.

 

 

How can you help here?

The company wants to understand and process the data coming out of data engineering pipelines: 

• Clean, sanitize and manipulate data to get useful features out of raw fields

• Make sense out of the raw data and help the data science team to build forecasting models on it

 

 

Dataset

Dataset Link:  delhivery_data.csv

Steps to download the dataset:

Open the dataset link, which will launch a new browser window displaying the raw data.
In the newly opened window, right-click on any empty space without selecting any text, then choose "Save As."
A window will appear, prompting you to select the destination folder where you want to save the dataset.
Choose the desired location, provide a suitable name for the dataset, and ensure to include the ".csv" extension. Finally, click on the "Save" button. 
 

Column Profiling:

data - tells whether the data is testing or training data                         
trip_creation_time – Timestamp of trip creation
route_schedule_uuid – Unique Id for a particular route schedule
route_type – Transportation type 
FTL – Full Truck Load: FTL shipments get to the destination sooner, as the truck is making no other pickups or drop-offs along the way
Carting: Handling system consisting of small vehicles (carts)
trip_uuid - Unique ID given to a particular trip   (A trip may include different source and destination centers)                
source_center - Source ID of trip origin                 
source_name - Source Name of trip origin

osrm_distance – An open-source routing engine which computes the shortest path between points in a given map (Includes usual traffic, distance through major and minor roads) (Cumulative)
factor  –  Unknown field                 
segment_actual_time – This is a segment time. Time taken by the subset of the package delivery
segment_osrm_time –  This is the OSRM segment time. Time taken by the subset of the package delivery

Concept Used: 

Feature Creation
Relationship between Features
Column Normalization /Column Standardization 
Handling categorical values  
Missing values - Outlier treatment / Types of outliers
 

 

How to begin:

Since delivery details of one package are divided into several rows (think of it as connecting flights to reach a particular destination). Now think about how we should treat their fields if we combine these rows? What aggregation would make sense if we merge. What would happen to the numeric fields if we merge the rows? 

Hint: You can use inbuilt functions like groupby and aggregations like sum(), cumsum() to merge some rows based on their 1. Trip_uuid, Source ID and Destination ID 2. Further aggregate on the basis of just Trip_uuid. You can also keep the first and last values for some numeric/categorical fields if aggregating them won’t make sense.

 

Basic data cleaning and exploration:
Handle missing values in the data.
Analyze the structure of the data.
Try merging the rows using the hint mentioned above.
Build some features to prepare the data for actual analysis. Extract features from the below fields:
Destination Name: Split and extract features out of destination. City-place-code (State)
Source Name: Split and extract features out of destination. City-place-code (State)
Trip_creation_time: Extract features like month, year and day etc
In-depth analysis and feature engineering:
Calculate the time taken between od_start_time and od_end_time and keep it as a feature. Drop the original columns, if required
Compare the difference between Point a. and start_scan_to_end_scan. Do hypothesis testing/ Visual analysis to check.
Do hypothesis testing/ visual analysis between actual_time aggregated value  and OSRM time aggregated value (aggregated values are the values you’ll get after merging the  rows on the basis of trip_uuid) 
Do hypothesis testing/ visual analysis between actual_time aggregated value  and segment actual time aggregated value (aggregated values are the values you’ll get after merging the rows on the basis of trip_uuid) 
Do hypothesis testing/ visual analysis between osrm distance aggregated value  and segment osrm distance aggregated value (aggregated values are the values you’ll get after merging the rows on the basis of trip_uuid) 
Do hypothesis testing/ visual analysis between osrm time aggregated value  and segment osrm time aggregated value (aggregated values are the values you’ll get after merging the rows on the basis of trip_uuid) 
Find outliers in the numerical variables (you might find outliers in almost all the variables), and check it using visual analysis 
Handle the outliers using the IQR method.
Do one-hot encoding of categorical variables (like route_type)
Normalize/ Standardize the numerical features using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.
